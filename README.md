# A Simple Clicker Chrome Extension

Simply download the zip and extract.

Open your Chrome Extensions and enable developer mode.

Finally, click "Load Unpacked", and select the extracted root folder.



This is a very simple project that aims to teach myself and others the basic necessities of developing a Chrome Extension by implementing a clicker app that
utilizes the chrome.storage API. Feel free to modify it as you please!
